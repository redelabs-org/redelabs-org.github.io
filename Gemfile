# Specify Jekyll version - using one known to work from previous steps
# '~> 4.3' implies >= 4.3.0 and < 4.4.0. The installed one was 4.4.1.
# To be safer and use what was installed:
gem 'jekyll', '~> 4.3' # Sticking to a known good version for now, can update later.

# Specify the theme (minima was used in setup)
gem "minima", "~> 2.5"

# Useful plugins
gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.17" # Matches version from successful run
gem "jekyll-seo-tag", "~> 2.8" # Good for SEO
gem "webrick", "~> 1.7" # For `jekyll serve` on Ruby 3.0+

group :jekyll_plugins do
  # Add other Jekyll plugins here if needed later.
  # For example:
  # gem "jekyll-sitemap"
end
gem "bootstrap", "~> 5.1"
